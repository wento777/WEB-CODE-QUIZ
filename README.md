# WEB-CODE-QUIZ

- This project was designed as a homework assignment for KU coding bootcamp in Module 4 Challenge .

- The purpose of this challenge was to build a web code quiz challenge, using our knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript .

- This is a code quiz challenge application using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. This application emphasizes the use of Javascript to provide quiz questions and collect user data to determine whether the answers to a question are correct.

- In this challenge i learn how to add questions, choices and answers selections.

- The usage of methods such as EventListener, createElement, and appendChild were key. Understanding their syntax really enables you to get through this challenge.

- A major aspect of this challenge was the balance between figuring out which solution made sense and the solution that would be most efficient. 

- This project has been deployed to GitHub. To get this project up and running, you can follow the deployment link.
